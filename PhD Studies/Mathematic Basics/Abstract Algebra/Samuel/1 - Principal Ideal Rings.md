>[!def] Definition Divisibility over Integral Domains ([[../../../../PDFs/samuel1970.pdf#page=15|Source]])
>Let 
>- $A$ be an [[../Judson and Dummit/1 - Algebraic Structures#^f48d09|integral domain]]
>- $K$ be a [[0 - Elementary Knowledge#^771c8d|Field of Fractions]]

>Given $$y=ax$$
>1. we say equivalently

><br>
>Generally, we speak of **<span style="color:#38ffa9">divisibility in $K$ with respect to $A$</span>**, which means the divisibility depends on $y$ being a multiple of  $x$ by some $a \in A$.
>
>2. Further, for $x \in K$ we write $Ax$ for the set of multiples of $x$, thus we may write
>$$y \in Ax \iff Ay \subset Ax\iff x \;|\; y$$
>where the set $Ax$ is called **<span style="color:#38ffa9">principal fractional ideal of $K$ with respect to $A$</span>**.<br><br>
>>[!note]- Note on the expression $Ay \subset Ax$
>><br>
>>
>> The condition $Ay \subset Ax$ means that every element of the ideal $Ay$ is also an element of $Ax$. In other words, each multiple of $y$ can be written as a multiple of $x$. This implies there exists some element $a \in A$ such that $y=ax$.

>3. Further, **<span style="color:#38ffa9">$Ax$ is the (ordinary) [[../Judson and Dummit/4 - Ideals and Ideals on Polynomials#^04f3cf|principal]] ideal of $A$ generated by $x$</span>**.

>[!def] Definition Units in Rings
>Let $A$ be a ring. A **<span style="color:#38ffa9">unit</span>** $u \in A$ has a multiplicative inverse in $A$, meaning there exists some $v \in A$ such that:
>$$u \cdot v = 1$$
>and $1$ being the multiplicative identity element.

>[!property] Property Associates in an Integral Domain
>Let $A$ be an [[../Judson and Dummit/1 - Algebraic Structures#^f48d09|integral domain]]. Given two elements $x,y \in A$ with $x,y \neq 0$, we have
>$$x \;|\; y \land y \;|\; x \;\not\!\!\!\implies x=y$$
>We say $x$ and $y$ are **<span style="color:#3884ff">associates</span>** but they are not equal. We also say that $x$ and $y$ **<span style="color:#3884ff">differ by a unit</span>**. We denote **<span style="color:#3884ff">the set of units of $A$ as $A^*$</span>**.
>>[!example]-
>>Let $K = \mathbb{Q}$ and $A= \mathbb{Z}$ with $x,y \in K$ with $$\begin{align}
>> x &= 3 \\
>> y &= -3
>>\end{align}$$
>>we have $$x=-1 \cdot y$$
>>where $a=-1$. Finally, we can see that
>>$$3 \;|\; -3 \land - 3 \;|\; 3  \text{ but } -3 \neq 3 $$
>>The **<span style="color:#f7b8ff">unit element</span>** here is $\frac{-3}{-3}=\frac{3}{3}=-1$.

>[!property] Property Equivalency of Associates over a Fractional Field $F$
>Let $K$ be a Field of Fractions and $A$ an integral domain. Let $x,y \in K$ with $x,y \neq 0$
>$$x \;|\; y \land y \;|\; x$$
>then we can say
>$$Ax = Ay$$
>>[!proof]- Proof
>>$$\begin{align}
>> x \;|\; y \iff y =ax \quad & \text{ for } a \in A \\
>> y \;|\; x \iff x = by \quad & \text{ for } b \in A
>>\end{align}$$
>>Because of 
>>$$x \;|\; y \land y \;|\; x$$
>>$x,y$ are [[#^56e245|associates]]. Therefore, $a,b$ are [[#^1c642e|units]] in $A$. Further the elements of the set $Ax$ can be characterized with 
>>$$Ax = \{ ax \mid a \in A \}$$
>>We get
>>$$\underbrace{ by }_{ \in Ay }=b(ax)=\underbrace{ \underbrace{ (ba) }_{ \in A }x }_{ \in Ax }$$

>[!example] Examples
>1. Denote $K$ being a field, then $K^* = K\setminus\{ 0 \}$  
> 2. Denote $A^*$ the set of units, then for 
> $$A = \mathbb{Z} \implies A^*=\{ -1,1 \}$$
> 3. Denote the [[../Judson and Dummit/7 - Polynomial Rings#^a2163f|ring of polynomials]] $B=A[X_{1},\dots X_{n}]$ on the integral domain $A$. The units of $A$ are the invertible constants, hence $B^* =A^*$.
> >[!remark] Remark: Only constant polynoms can have invertibles.

>[!def] Definition Principal Ideal Ring ([[../../../../PDFs/samuel1970.pdf#page=15|Source]])
>A ring $A$ is called a **<span style="color:#38ffa9">principal ideal ring</span>** if it is an [[../Judson and Dummit/1 - Algebraic Structures#^f48d09|integral domain]] and if every [[../Judson and Dummit/4 - Ideals and Ideals on Polynomials#^2baf0e|ideal]] of $A$ is [[../Judson and Dummit/4 - Ideals and Ideals on Polynomials#^04f3cf|principal]]

>>[!note] Note, an ideal $I$ of $G$ is principal if it is <u>generated by a single element</u> from $G$.
>
>>[!example]
>>1. $\mathbb{Z}$ is a **<span style="color:#f7b8ff">principal ideal ring</span>**
>>
>>>[!proof]-
>>>Given that $n=0$, and we have the ideal $I=\left\langle 0 \right\rangle$ we are done, because this ideal can only be generated by $n=0$.
>>>
>>>Now suppose $I \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ is an ideal, because of the well ordering principle we can find the smallest non-negative element $n \in I$. 
>>>
>>>We now claim that $\left\langle n \right\rangle = I$. It can be easily seen that $\left\langle n \right\rangle \subseteq I$, because both are ideals and $I$ should *at least* contain all multiples of $n \in I$. Now we show that we also have $I \subseteq \left\langle n \right\rangle$, therefore we take some $m \in I$ and use the [[../../../../Lehre/Kryptologie/2 - Algebraische und Zahlentheoretische Grundlagen (1)#^30b120|division algorithm]]
>>>$$m = nq + r$$
>>>with $0 \leq r < n$, thus
>>>$$r = m-nq$$
>>>Since $nq \in I$ and the ideal is closed under addition, we have that $m - nq \in I$, but because $r$ is bounded by $n$ and $n$ is the smallest non-negative element in $I$, we get
>>>$$r=0$$
>>>Therefore we get $$m = nq$$
>>>which tells us, that $m$ is in the ideal generated by $n$, i.e. $m \in \left\langle n \right\rangle$. Hence, $$I \subseteq \left\langle n \right\rangle \land \left\langle n \right\rangle \subseteq I \implies I = \left\langle n \right\rangle   \tag*{$\square$}$$
>>>
>>>>[!note] Note, the ideal $\left\langle 2\,,\,3 \right\rangle = \{ 2a+3b \mid a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ can be reduced to $\left\langle \text{gcd}(2,3) \right\rangle = \left\langle 1 \right\rangle = \mathbb{Z}$.
>>
>>2. Let $K$ be a field. Then the ring $K[X]$ is a **<span style="color:#f7b8ff">principal ideal ring</span>**
>>
>>>[!proof]-
>>> First let $\left\langle 0 \right\rangle = I \subseteq K[X]$. Clearly, $I = \{ 0 \}$, hence the zero-polynomial is the only element which can generate $I$.
>>>
>>> Now, let $p(X) \in I \subseteq K[X]$ be the polynomial of smallest degree. We can state that $\left\langle p(X) \right\rangle \subseteq I$ since $p(X) \in I$ its multiples must also be contained in $I$. It remains to show that $I \subseteq \left\langle p(X) \right\rangle$. Now let $s(X) \in I$ and by the division algorithm of polynomials we have for $r(X) = 0$ or $0 <\text{deg}(r(X)) <\text{deg}(q(X))$
>>> $$s(X) = p(X)q(X)+r(X)$$
>>> then we can write
>>> $$r(X)=s(X)-p(X)q(X)$$
>>> since $s(X) \in I$ and $p(X)q(X) \in I$ and $I$ is closed under addition $s(X)-p(X)q(X) \in I$. Further note, that $p(X)$ is already the smallest degree polynomial in $I$, therefore $r(X)=0$. Hence, we get
>>> $$p(X)q(X) = s(X)$$
>>> which is in $I$. Therefore, $I \subseteq \left\langle p(X) \right\rangle$ and we get
>>> $$I \subseteq \left\langle p(X) \right\rangle \land \left\langle p(X) \right\rangle \subseteq I \implies I = \left\langle p(X) \right\rangle \tag*{$\square$}$$
