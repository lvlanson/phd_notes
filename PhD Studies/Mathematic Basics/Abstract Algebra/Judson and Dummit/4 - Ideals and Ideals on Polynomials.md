>[!lemma] Proposition
>Let $R$ be a ring and let $I$ be an ideal of $R$. Then the additive quotient group $R/I$ is a ring under the binary operations
>$$\begin{align}
> (r+I) + (s+I) &=(r+s)+I \\
> (r+I) \cdot (s+I) &= (rs) + I
>\end{align}$$ 
>for $\forall r,s \in R$. Conversely, if $I$ is any subgroup such that the above operations are well defined, then $I$ is an ideal of $R$.
>>[!remark]
>>Note, any kernel of a ring homomorphism $\text{ker }\phi$ is an ideal $I$ by [[3 - Rings#^0d99e8|this proposition]]. 

>[!def] Definition Principal Ideal on Rings ([[../../../../PDFs/judson2022.pdf#page=208|Source]])
>  Let $R$ be a [[1 - Algebraic Structures#^4a5286|commutative ring]] with identity. The ideal generated by a single element $a \in R$ is called the **<span style="color:#38ffa9">principal ideal generated by $a$</span>** and is denoted by:
>  $$\langle a \rangle = \{ ar \mid r \in R \} \subset R$$
>  This ideal consists of all multiples of all multiples of $a$ by elements of $R$.

>[!theorem] Theorem Principal Ideals of $\mathbb{Z}$ ([[../../../../PDFs/judson2022.pdf#page=208|Source]])
>Every ideal in the ring of integer $\mathbb{Z}$ is a principal ideal.
>>[!proof]-
>> First note, the *zero ideal* $\{ 0 \}$ is a [[#^04f3cf|principal ideal]], since $\langle 0 \rangle=\{ 0 \}$.
>>
>> If $I$ is a *non-zero ideal* in $\mathbb{Z}$, then $I$ must contain non-negative integers. Denote the set
>> $$S = \{ m \in I \mid m>0 \}$$
>> Further, by the *well-ordering principle* denote
>> $$n = \min T$$
>> Now let $a \in I$. By the [[../../../../Lehre/Kryptologie/2 - Algebraische und Zahlentheoretische Grundlagen (1)#^30b120|division algorithm]] we know $\exists! q,r \in \mathbb{Z}$  such that
>> $$a=nq+r$$
>> with $0 \leq r <n$. This is equivalent to
>> $$r=\underbrace{ a }_{ \in I }-\underbrace{ nq }_{ \in I } $$
>> Since the subtracting elements of an ideal returns an ideal element, we know $r \in I$. By the condition $0 \leq r < n$ we conclude $r=0$, hence
>> $$a=nq$$
>> Therefore
>> $$\langle n \rangle = I\tag*{$\square$}$$
>>

## Ideals in $F[x]$

>[!def] Definition Principal Ideal in $F[x]$ ([[../../../../PDFs/judson2022.pdf#page=230|Source]])
>Let $F$ be a [[1 - Algebraic Structures#^a17f1c|field]]. $F[x]$ is an ideal $\langle p(x)\rangle$ generated by some polynomial $p(x)$, i.e.
>$$\langle p(x)\rangle= \{ p(x)q(x):q(x) \in F[x] \}$$

>>[!example] Example: The polynomial $x^2$ in $F[x]$ generates the ideal $\langle x^2 \rangle$
