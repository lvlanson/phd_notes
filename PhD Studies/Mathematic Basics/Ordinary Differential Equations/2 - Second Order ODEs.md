>[!theorem] Theorem Wronskian (II)
>If $y_{1},y_{2}$ are fundamental solutions of $L(y)=0$ on $I \subset \mathbb{R}$, then $W_{12}(t) \neq 0$ on $I$.
>>[!proof] Proof is given by the inverse Corollary

>[!Corollary] Corollary Inverse Wronskian (II) Theorem 
>If $y_{1},y_{2}$ are solutions of $L(y)=0$ on $I \subset \mathbb{R}$ and there is a point $t_{1} \in I$ such that $W_{12}(t_{1})=0$, then $y_{1},y_{2}$ are linearly dependent on $I$.
>>[!proof]-
>>By the theorem's condition we know that $y_{1},y_{2}$ are solutions of $L(y)=0$ on $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. By [[#^78710b|Abel's theorem]] we know
>>$$W_{12}(t)=W_{12}(t_{0})e^{-A_{1}(t)}$$
>>for any $t_{0} \in I$. We choose $t_0$ to be $t_1$ and have by the corollary
>>$$W_{12}(t_{1})= 0$$
>>since the claim is valid for any $t_{0} \in I$ we can generalize the statement as
>>$$W_{12}(t) = 0 \quad \forall t\in I$$
>>The Wronskian vanishes identically on $I$, i.e.
>>$$y_{1}y_{2}' - y_{1}'y_{2} = 0$$
>>1. Case: $y_{1}$ or $y_{2}$ are  the zero function => $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are linearly dependent :luc_check:
>>2. Case: we choose $y_1$ to be non-zero on the open neighborhood $I_{1} \subset I$ of $t_1$, such that we can write
>>$$\begin{alignat}{2}
>>y_{1}y_{2}'-y_{1}'y_{2} &= 0 \qquad&&\Big\vert :y_{1}^2 \\
>>\frac{y_{1}y_{2}'-y_{1}'y_{2}}{y_{1}^2} &= 0 \tag{Division Rule}\\
>> \left( \frac{y_{2}}{y_{1}} \right)' &= 0 \qquad&&\Big\vert \int  \, dt   \\
>> \frac{y_{2}}{y_{1}}  &= c \qquad&&\Big\vert \int  \, dt   \\
>>\end{alignat}$$
>>Hence $y_{1},y_{2}$ are proportional on the open set $I_{1}$ and by the [[#^2aec50| remark on proportionality]] we know they are linearly dependent. Hence, we have $y_{\text{gen}}=y_{2}-cy_{1}$. By the corollary, [[#^786ff5| the solution theorem]] and the [[#^dec49d| linearity]], we have
>>$$L(y) = 0 \;\;\text{ with } \;\; y(t_{1})=0, \;\; y'(t_{1})=0$$
>>therefore, $y(t)=0$ over all $t \in I$, hence $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$ are linearly dependent.
>>$$\begin{align}
