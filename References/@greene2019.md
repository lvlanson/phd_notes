>[!ABSTRACT]-
><br><h4>For first-year graduate courses in Econometrics for Social Scientists.</h4> <br><p>Bridging the gap between social science studies and econometric analysis Designed to bridge the gap between social science studies and field-econometrics, Econometric Analysis, 8th Edition, Global Edition, presents this ever-growing area at an accessible graduate level. The book first introduces students to basic techniques, a rich variety of models, and underlying theory that is easy to put into practice. It then presents students with a sufficient theoretical background to understand advanced techniques and to recognise new variants of established models. This focus, along with hundreds of worked numerical examples, ensures that students can apply the theory to real-world application and are prepared to be successful economists in the field.</p> <br><br>
