>[!ABSTRACT]-
>As we enter the age of universal electronic connectivity in which viruses, hackers, electronic eavesdropping, and electronic fraud can threaten the prosperity and productivity of corporations and individuals, security is increasingly important. Fortunately, the disciplines of cryptography and network security have matured, leading to the development of practical, available applications to enforce network security. Best-selling author and two-time winner of the TEXTY award for the best computer science and engineering text, William Stallings provides a practical survey of both the principles and practice of cryptography and network security. Extensively reorganized to provide the optimal sequence for classroom instruction and self-study, the second edition includes these key features. Looks at system-level security issues, including the threat of and countermeasures for intruders and viruses, and the use of firewalls and trusted systems. NEW - Discussion of block cipher design principles, plus coverage of Blowfish, CAST-128, Triple DES, and other algorithms NEW - Chapters on IP security and Web security Expanded coverage of public-key encryption algorithms and design principles, including RSA and elliptic curve cryptography Covers important network security tools and applications, including Kerberos, X.509v3, PGP, S/MIME, IP security, SSL/TLS, and SET On-line transparency masters, an Internet mailing list, and links to relevant web sites are available to http: //www.shore.net/~ws/Security2e.html
