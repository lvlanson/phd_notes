T he most successful new calculus text in the last two decades The much-anticipated 3rd Edition of Briggs' Calculus Series retains its hallmark features while introducing important advances and refinements. Briggs, Cochran, Gillett, and Schulz build from a foundation of meticulously crafted exercise sets, then draw students into the narrative through writing that reflects the voice of the instructor. Examples are stepped out and thoughtfully annotated, and figures are designed to teach rather than simply supplement the narrative. The groundbreaking eBook contains approximately 700 Interactive Figures that can be manipulated to shed light on key concepts. For the 3rd Edition, the authors synthesized feedback on the text and MyLab(TM) Math content from over 140 instructors and an Engineering Review Panel. This thorough and extensive review process, paired with the authors' own teaching experiences, helped create a text that was designed for today's calculus instructors and students.

By combining trusted author content with digital tools and a flexible platform, MyLab Math personalizes the learning experience and improves results for each student.
