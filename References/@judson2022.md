>[!ABSTRACT]-
>Abstract Algebra: Theory and Applications is an open-source textbook that is designed to teach the principles and theory of abstract algebra to college juniors and seniors in a rigorous manner. Its strengths include a wide range of exercises, both computational and theoretical, plus many non-trivial applications. The first half of the book presents group theory, through the Sylow theorems, with enough material for a semester-long course. The second half is suitable for a second semester and presents rings, integral domains, Boolean algebras, vector spaces, and fields, concluding with Galois Theory.
